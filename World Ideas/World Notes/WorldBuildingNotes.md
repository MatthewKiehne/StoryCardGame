# Main Ideas
## Magic
Magic originates from observation and belief. The magic system is based around the question, If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound.  In this magic system, if nobody is around to hear the tree fall then the tree does not make a sound. The tree only makes a sound if someone is observing it or there is a belief that the tree does make a sound when it falls.

With this system, things that are not thought about or observed slowly go away Into Obscurity. Well things that people now believe in, slowly become more possible the more people believe in it.

The gods observe all things at all times and believe in the things that they created. The champions have a huge amount of belief in the world around them but cannot observe everything. The Heralds of the champions have even less belief than the Champions do and can only observe the world around them. The common Folk observe only the world around them and have very little belief individually. Even though the common folk have very little belief individually, if enough common folk believe something, their belief rivals that of a champion.

#### [[Obscurite]] Gems
This is a gem that are produced by the [[Champions]] when they repress their magical powers. The Champions build up power within them and then concentrate it within a magical gem. They then teleport that gem to a random location within a 25 miles of them

## Ancient Conflict
The two gods, Order and Infinity, create pocket dimensions to play war games against each other. They each create four champions and races for each of the champions. They would pin these champions and races against each other and the first to loose three out of the four champions would loose. The loosing side would then concede the loss and the two gods would leave the pocket dimension which would cause the pocket dimension to eventually collapse and destroy itself. 

## Will of the Living
Wilds beasts do not weaver in will, unlike man. Beasts do not know anything other than who they are and what their instincts tell them to do. Only from sentience, comes a wavering of will power. All sentient beings usually have less will power than their corresponding beasts.

## Collapsing World
The world is collapsing because the will of of the living beings is not enough to sustain the pocket dimension they are residing in.

## Planes of Existence
There are only two different planes of existence, the physical  and the spiritual. They physical plane is where all of the adventures take place in. The spiritual is where all the souls reside when they are not tied to a physical form.
